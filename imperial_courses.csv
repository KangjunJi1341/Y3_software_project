Predicted grades and scores in your application are important, but it's not the only thing that drives the decision. Our selectors will also consider things like your personal statement and your references to understand whether there is a good match between you and your chosen subject and department at Imperial. You can read more about our selection process, including tips on writing a personal statement, in our How to Apply section. If assessment of your UCAS application indicates that you are likely to satisfy our requirements, you will be shortlisted for an academic interview as part of our interview programme. There will be a pre-recorded talk by the admissions tutor made available online, about the department, the structure of the course and other opportunities available to enrich your experience with us. There will also be talks and presentations available by the accommodation and finance teams, and from Horizons about the great range of modules they offer. We are organising online Q&A sessions, where you will have the chance to talk to the admissions tutor and to current undergraduates, and you can see more about the department on the Chemistry and Virtual Tour websites. We will run interviews in the morning and afternoon (UK time) to accommodate students in different time-zones, and each applicant will be interviewed individually. The interview will comprise a discussion with an experienced academic who will be looking to assess an applicant's motivation for studying chemistry and their potential for the future. Although the discussion may begin with topics mentioned in the UCAS personal statement, the conversations will likely expand to cover topics that the applicant may not be so familiar with. This enables the interviewer to observe how an applicant thinks and how they reason their way through a problem. The interviewers are highly experienced and are able to see through nerves, stress and silly mistakes so you should not worry about answering the questions. There are no trick questions, if an answer seems obvious, it might be just that. We then use the interview feedback in combination with the UCAS application, to decide whether we are able to make an offer, and what the conditions of the offer will be. We will be making offer decisions only after all interviews are complete. We will aim to contact all applicants directly by e-mail, by early March with a decision.

Predicted grades and scores in your application are important, but it's not the only thing that drives the decision. Our selectors will also consider things like your personal statement and your references to understand whether there is a good match between you and your chosen subject and department at Imperial. You can read more about our selection process, including tips on writing a personal statement, in our How to Apply section. If assessment of your UCAS application indicates that you are likely to satisfy our requirements, you will be shortlisted for an academic interview as part of our interview programme. There will be a pre-recorded talk by the admissions tutor made available online, about the department, the structure of the course and other opportunities available to enrich your experience with us. There will also be talks and presentations available by the accommodation and finance teams, and from Horizons about the great range of modules they offer. We are organising online Q&A sessions, where you will have the chance to talk to the admissions tutor and to current undergraduates, and you can see more about the department on the Chemistry and Virtual Tour websites. We will run interviews in the morning and afternoon (UK time) to accommodate students in different time-zones, and each applicant will be interviewed individually. The interview will comprise a discussion with an experienced academic who will be looking to assess an applicant's motivation for studying chemistry and their potential for the future. Although the discussion may begin with topics mentioned in the UCAS personal statement, the conversations will likely expand to cover topics that the applicant may not be so familiar with. This enables the interviewer to observe how an applicant thinks and how they reason their way through a problem. The interviewers are highly experienced and are able to see through nerves, stress and silly mistakes so you should not worry about answering the questions. There are no trick questions, if an answer seems obvious, it might be just that. We then use the interview feedback in combination with the UCAS application, to decide whether we are able to make an offer, and what the conditions of the offer will be. We will be making offer decisions only after all interviews are complete. We will aim to contact all applicants directly by e-mail, by early March with a decision.

Predicted grades and scores in your application are important, but it's not the only thing that drives the decision. Our selectors will also consider things like your personal statement and your references to understand whether there is a good match between you and your chosen subject and department at Imperial. You can read more about our selection process, including tips on writing a personal statement, in our How to Apply section. If assessment of your UCAS application indicates that you are likely to satisfy our requirements, you will be shortlisted for an academic interview as part of our interview programme. There will be a pre-recorded talk by the admissions tutor made available online, about the department, the structure of the course and other opportunities available to enrich your experience with us. There will also be talks and presentations available by the accommodation and finance teams, and from Horizons about the great range of modules they offer. We are organising online Q&A sessions, where you will have the chance to talk to the admissions tutor and to current undergraduates, and you can see more about the department on the Chemistry and Virtual Tour websites. We will run interviews in the morning and afternoon (UK time) to accommodate students in different time-zones, and each applicant will be interviewed individually. The interview will comprise a discussion with an experienced academic who will be looking to assess an applicant's motivation for studying chemistry and their potential for the future. Although the discussion may begin with topics mentioned in the UCAS personal statement, the conversations will likely expand to cover topics that the applicant may not be so familiar with. This enables the interviewer to observe how an applicant thinks and how they reason their way through a problem. The interviewers are highly experienced and are able to see through nerves, stress and silly mistakes so you should not worry about answering the questions. There are no trick questions, if an answer seems obvious, it might be just that. We then use the interview feedback in combination with the UCAS application, to decide whether we are able to make an offer, and what the conditions of the offer will be. We will be making offer decisions only after all interviews are complete. We will aim to contact all applicants directly by e-mail, by early March with a decision.

Booking for the October ESAT test sitting is now open. The ESAT is a computer-based, multiple-choice test, which is divided into a number of modules. You will sit the test in one of Pearson VUE's test centres – there are more than 5,500 to choose from in more than 180 countries. To be eligible for selection for this course, you will need to sit two ESAT modules: Each module is made up of 27 multiple-choice questions and lasts 40 minutes. Make a note of which modules you will need to sit for course(s) of interest as you will need this information when you book your test. There will be two test sittings for the ESAT for 2026 entry: Candidates can book a time slot on any of these test days though please note that tests in China will be available on only one day per test sitting. They will take place on the second day listed above for each test. For more details, please visit the UAT-UK website . You should take the test just once for courses starting in 2026 entry as only your first test score will be used by selectors. If you will be sitting the test for the first time this year then you will first need to create a UAT-UK account with Pearson VUE. You'll be able to do that using a link that will be available on this page within the UAT-UK website in June. It is your responsibility to book and sit your test within the testing window. Find out more about the ESAT , including information on how to book, test fees, bursaries for UK candidates in financial need, access arrangements and how to prepare. If your application has demonstrated sufficient potential you will be invited for an online interview. These typically run from November to March.

Electrical and electronic engineering right now is characterised by its fast-evolving and interdisciplinary nature, driving innovation across unlimited applications, and making it such an exciting and rewarding place for creative and talented problem-solvers. Today's (and tomorrow's) electrical engineers are often working at the intersection of many other disciplines – computer science, business and economics, biomedical, physics and materials, mathematics, sustainability and mechanics. Our degree programmes are designed to give you room to explore the breadth of electrical and engineering topics, so you can take your time to choose a route that fits your developing skills and interests at every step. You'll choose a route that fits your developing interests and career plans, with modules led by our research strengths, and projects and coursework drawn from our latest research, focused on inspiring and supporting tomorrow's industry-ready, creative engineers. Students studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering learn how to design anything that involves electrons and electromagnetism, from transistors, sensors, actuators, wireless communication systems to electrical power systems and more. They also learn how to design algorithms and software for the next generation of autonomous and robotic systems, which extract information from data and make automatic decisions on how to interpret and react to this information. The Department's common first year programme gives all students the same solid academic grounding in the engineering skills and theory you'll need for whichever route you choose next, and you'll have the opportunity to ask all the questions to help you decide your next move. A focus on highly practical lab work will help underpin your understanding of the theory. You will develop your programming skills by learning C++. Year two follows a core programme tailored to your chosen route, completing the fundamentals in analogue and digital electronics, power electronics, communications and control, alongside a strong focus on mathematics and computing. In your third and final year, you'll select from a number of more advanced technical modules, so you can choose to take a wide-ranging programme of study, or to concentrate your expertise in a particular field. You'll apply your knowledge and skills to increasingly ambitious project work throughout the course, ultimately showcasing your imagination, creativity and independent engineering expertise in a substantial final year project of your choice.",/engineering/departments/electrical-engineering/,"{""Year 1"": {""overview"": ""You'll study the following core modules during your first year."", ""groups"": {""Core modules"": {""items"": [{""title"": ""Mathematics 1A"", ""description"": ""Understand why mathematics is the foundation of all engineering practice and build the robust mathematics skills needed to proceed to more complex modules.""}, {""title"": ""Mathematics 1B"", ""description"": ""Build on your learning from Mathematics 1A and appreciate fundamental mathematical principles in an engineering context.""}, {""title"": ""Topics in Electrical Engineering"", ""description"": ""Familiarise yourself with the interdisciplinary nature of electrical engineering and analyse the generation, transport and management of electrical power systems.""}, {""title"": ""Analysis and Design of Circuits"", ""description"": ""Build a foundation in the analysis and design of electronic circuits, and explore key concepts that are essential for higher level study of electronics.""}, {""title"": ""Digital and Computer Architecture"", ""description"": ""Develop your understanding of digital design and low-level computer operation to understand system design across the hardware - software boundary.""}, {""title"": ""Programming for Engineers"", ""description"": ""Become familiar with programming using C++ and learn standard imperative programming skills such as control-flow, variables, and data structures.""}, {""title"": ""Electronics Design Project"", ""description"": ""Apply your knowledge to a major group design project which considers the full design process, from the client brief to the demonstration of a prototype.""}]}}}, ""Year 2"": {""overview"": ""You'll study the following core modules during your second year."", ""groups"": {""Core modules"": {""items"": [{""title"": ""Mathematics for Engineers"", ""description"": ""Build on your first year studies to cover more advanced topics in mathematics that are relevant to both electrical and information engineering.""}, {""title"": ""Signal and Systems"", ""description"": ""Learn how to take data in one domain and transform it to another domain to help analysis, and understand fundamental principles such as sampling and transforms.""}, {""title"": ""Electromagnetism"", ""description"": ""Understand why electromagnetic systems are ubiquitous in electrical engineering and apply the techniques of Vector Calculus to obtain analytical solutions to problems.""}, {""title"": ""Circuits and Systems"", ""description"": ""Build on your first year learning to analyse and design electronic circuits with a system level perspective.""}, {""title"": ""Power Electronics and Power Systems"", ""description"": ""Explore the generation, transmission and applications of electrical power.""}, {""title"": ""Communications"", ""description"": ""Discover how information is transmitted from one point to another in the presence of noise and build your awareness of information theory.""}, {""title"": ""Control Systems"", ""description"": ""Become acquainted with basic elements of the theory of dynamic systems and the techniques used to design automatic control systems.""}, {""title"": ""Electronics Design Project 2"", ""description"": ""Apply your knowledge to a major group design project which considers the full design process, from the client brief to the demonstration of a prototype.""}]}}}, ""Year 3"": {""overview"": ""You'll study the following core modules during your third year.

Electrical and electronic engineering right now is characterised by its fast-evolving and interdisciplinary nature, driving innovation across unlimited applications, and making it such an exciting and rewarding place for creative and talented problem-solvers. Today's (and tomorrow's) electrical engineers are often working at the intersection of many other disciplines – computer science, business and economics, biomedical, physics and materials, mathematics, sustainability and mechanics. Our degree programmes are designed to give you room to explore the breadth of electrical and engineering topics, so you can take your time to choose a route that fits your developing skills and interests at every step. Our programmes are led by our research strengths, with projects and coursework drawn from our latest research, and focused on inspiring and supporting tomorrow's industry-ready, creative engineers. You'll choose a route that fits your developing interests and career plans, with pathways that include advanced software and computer systems skills, business studies or a year abroad. Students studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering learn how to design anything that involves electrons and electromagnetism, from transistors, sensors, actuators, wireless communication systems to electrical power systems and more. They also learn how to design algorithms and software for the next generation of autonomous and robotic systems, which extract information from data and make automatic decisions on how to interpret and react to this information. The Department's common first year programme gives all students the same solid academic grounding in the engineering skills and theory you'll need for whichever route you choose next, and you'll have the opportunity to ask all the questions to help you decide your next move. . A focus on highly practical lab work will help underpin your understanding of the theory. You will develop your programming skills by learning C++. Year two follows a core programme completing the fundamentals in analogue and digital electronics, power electronics, communications and control, alongside a strong focus on mathematics and computing. In your third year, you'll select from a choice of focused modules, so you can take a wide-ranging programme of study, or to concentrate your expertise in a particular field. You'll also have the option to take a six-month industrial placement and experience engineering in action, or to be part of a team project acting as consultants on a design challenge proposed by an industrial client. This involves creating a pre-production prototype of an innovative product or technical solution. The final year of the MEng course offers an extensive range of advanced specialist modules inspired by the very latest research. You'll apply your knowledge and skills to increasingly ambitious project work throughout the course, ultimately showcasing your imagination, creativity and independent engineering expertise in a substantial final year project of your choice.

Students studying Electronic and Information Engineering learn how to design any ​ kind of computer from microprocessors to mobile phones, laptops to servers and networks of servers.​ They also learn to design algorithms and software ​ for the next generation of autonomous and robotic systems, which extract information from data and make automatic decisions on how to interpret and react to this information.​ The Department's common first year programme gives everyone the same solid academic grounding in the engineering skills and theory you'll need for whichever route you choose next, and you'll have the opportunity to ask all the questions to help you decide your next move. A focus on highly practical lab work will help underpin your understanding of the theory.  You will develop your programming  skills by learning C++. Year two follows a core programme, completing the fundamentals in analogue and digital electronics, communications and control, alongside a strong focus on mathematics and computing, networks and high-level programming. You'll deepen your programming experience and become familiar with software design, programming concepts and tool use – skills that are transferable to any programming language and environment. In third year, you'll select from a number of focused modules, so you can choose to take a wide-ranging programme of study, or concentrate your expertise in a particular field. You'll also have the option to take a six-month industrial placement and experience engineering in action, or to be part of a team acting as consultants on a design challenge proposed by an industrial client. The final year offers an extensive range of advanced specialist modules inspired by the very latest research. You'll apply your knowledge and skills to increasingly ambitious project work throughout the course, ultimately showcasing your imagination, creativity and independent engineering expertise in a substantial final year project.

You will sit the test in one of Pearson VUE's test centres – there are more than 5,500 to choose from in more than 180 countries. To be eligible for selection for this course, you will need to sit three ESAT modules: Each module is made up of 27 multiple-choice questions and lasts 40 minutes. Make a note of which modules you will need to sit for course(s) of interest as you will need this information when you book your test. There will be two test sittings for the ESAT for 2026 entry: Candidates can book a time slot on any of these test days though please note that tests in China will be available on only one day per test sitting. They will take place on the second day listed above for each test. For more details, please visit the UAT-UK website . You should take the test just once for courses starting in 2026 entry as only your first test score will be used by selectors. If you will be sitting the test for the first time this year then you will first need to create a UAT-UK account with Pearson VUE. You'll be able to do that using a link that will be available on this page within the UAT-UK website in June. It is your responsibility to book and sit your test within the testing window. Find out more about the ESAT , including information on how to book, test fees, bursaries for UK candidates in financial need, access arrangements and how to prepare. If your UCAS application indicates that you are likely to satisfy our requirements, your personal statement shows a clear interest in the subject, and you perform well in the admissions test, you may be invited for an online interview. The interview will be 25-30 minutes with a member of academic staff. We aim for the interview to be more of a conversation. You will be asked questions to understand your thought process and to see how you solve problems. The interviewer will also ask you about your motivation for the course. It may take a very long time for you to hear anything from us. This is because we accept applications right until the end of January, we read and assess applications very carefully, and we continue making decisions right up to the end of March.

For candidates who apply after the 19 December and are unable to sit the TMUA, conditional offers will typically require you to sit at least one Sixth Term Examination Paper ( STEP ). The Mathematics Admissions Test (MAT) is no longer used by Imperial. The TMUA is a computer-based, multiple-choice test, which tests your mathematical thinking and reasoning skills. You will sit the test in one of Pearson VUE's test centres – there are more than 5,500 to choose from in more than 180 countries. There will be two test sittings for the TMUA for 2026 entry: Candidates can book a time slot on any of these test days though please note that tests in China will be available on only one day per test sitting. They will take place on the second day listed above for each test. For more details, please visit the UAT-UK website . You should take the test just once for courses starting in 2026 entry as only your first test score will be used by selectors. If you will be sitting the test for the first time this year then you will first need to create a UAT-UK account with Pearson VUE. You'll be able to do that using a link that will be available on this page within the UAT-UK website in June. It is your responsibility to book and sit your test within the testing window. Find out more about the TMUA , including information on how to book, test fees, bursaries for UK candidates in financial need, access arrangements and how to prepare. Test requirements for 2025 entry are transitional as we move from the MAT to TMUA, and these requirements may be modified for 2026 entry.

Find out more about the UCAT and how to register for 2026 entry. The School of Medicine will initially review applications to ensure they meet our minimum academic entry requirements as outlined in our Study pages. Following receipt of UCAT scores in November, we then begin inviting candidates to attend our Multiple Mini Interviews (MMIs). Each year, we normally interview the top 1/3 of applicants and will send invitations on a rolling basis from December. Please make sure that emails from Imperial are on your/your School's safe senders list or that you check your spam folder so that you don't miss any notifications. Invitations will explain in detail how the interview will work. For 2026 entry, the number of Home places is 271 and Overseas places is 74. A contextualised cut-off will be applied to applicants who meet one or more of the following criteria: applicants identified as Widening Participation at the time of application; applicants who have declared carer status and submitted supporting evidence by 31 October 2025 in accordance with the Faculty of Medicine's widening participation page ; or applicants who are involved in the following Imperial Outreach programmes - Pathways to Medicine, Imperial STEM Potential, STEM Futures, m*Aths Online Programme, Further mA*ths Online Programme, Accelerate, Imperial Sutton Trust Summer School and Work Experience. For 2026 entry, all candidates who submitted special circumstances via UCAT will be examined carefully on a case-by-case basis. We are unable to consider any mitigating circumstances that do not come via UCAT directly. UCAT scores are used to help decide shortlisting for interview but are not the sole factor. Threshold scores will vary year to year depending on the distribution of scores in each cohort of applicants and the ratio of applicants to places. For 2025 entry, the Home Applicants shortlisted for interview had an SJT of Band 3 or above (Band 4 discounted), and their UCAT total scores were above 3000. For those Contextual Applicants who were shortlisted, again all had an SJT of Band 3 or above and their UCAT total scores were above 2800. Please note that UCAT scores for 2026 entry will be different due to the removal of the abstract reasoning section. This means that the test scores will have a lower maximum total score (2700 rather than 3600). This information is given simply as an indication of last year's scores for success in shortlisting, and it was the first year we had applied UCAT in the process. At this stage, we do not know what spread of UCAT scores will be applied to help shortlist for 2026 entry. All candidates who attend the test are declaring that they are fit to sit the test. If circumstances occur which might affect performance, candidates must refer to the UCAT Fitness to Test Policy before sitting their test.

You'll develop a broad understanding of mathematical theory and application and deepen your knowledge in areas that appeal to you. You will engage with concepts that are both a direct continuation of those at A-level, and others that introduce you to new ways of thinking. Your studies will cover the key areas of mathematics such as algebra, analysis, probability and statistics. You'll also explore topics such as the logical structure of arguments, the proper definition of mathematical objects, the design of sophisticated mathematical models, and the legitimacy of computations. As part of the Pure Mathematics specialisation, you will examine a variety of relevant concepts including Algebraic Number Theory, Functional Analysis, Topology and Probability Theory. You will also have the opportunity to choose from over 50 specialised modules – many of which are linked to our cutting-edge research and led by pre-eminent experts in their fields.
